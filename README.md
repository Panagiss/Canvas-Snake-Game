# Gameplay
A 608x608p Canvas frame with a Snake trying to eat as much fruits as it can. Use your "Up" "Right" "Down" "Left" Buttons to move the Snake. Your goal is to Eat as many Fruits as you can. The more you eat the bigger the snake grows. On this Snake game you cannot go to one border and come from the opposite one. Canvas is framed so if you hit the walls/border you Lose.
